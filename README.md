# Fake Image Detection System

Detecting fake or manipulated images in today's digital age has become increasingly challenging due to the advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This project aims to develop a robust and effective fake image detection system that can differentiate between genuine and manipulated images generated by GAN models.

Creating a detailed code for a fake image detection system using robust hashing and training it with a specific dataset would require a significant amount of code and resources. However, I can provide with a simplified Python code outline that can be used as a starting point. Note that this is a simplified example, and building a robust fake image detection system would typically involve more complex preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. Additionally, we would need to gather or create a dataset of real and fake images for training.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into the following components:

1. `training_model.py`: This script is responsible for training the fake image detection model. It extracts image features, preprocesses data, and fine-tunes the model using a GridSearchCV approach.

2. `testing_model.py`: Use this script to test the trained fake image detection model. You can provide an image as input, and the model will classify it as real or fake.

3. `utils.py`: This file contains utility functions for image preprocessing, hashing, and other operations used in the training and testing scripts.

4. `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages and their versions.

5. `dataset` : Contains the required dataset to train the model.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the fake image detection system:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/fake-image-detection.git
cd fake-image-detection
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 3: Training the Model

To train the fake image detection model, follow these steps:

```bash
python training_model.py
```
This script will train the model and save it as 'best_fake_image_detection_model.pkl'.

### Step 4: Testing the Model
To test the model with an input image, use the 'testing_model.py' script. Replace 'your_model_path' with the actual path to the saved model:
```bash
python testing_model.py
```
Provide the path to the input image when prompted. The script will classify the image as real or fake.

## Dependencies
* Flask
* NumPy
* OpenCV (cv2)
* PIL (Pillow)
* scikit-learn
* joblib

## Experimentation
You can experiment with different feature extraction and classification techniques to improve the model's performance. In the 'training_model.py' script, you can modify the preprocessing, scaling, dimensionality reduction, and classifier options. Use scikit-learn's GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameter combinations.

Remember to save the best model obtained from experimentation for future use.

## Dataset
Ensure that you have a dataset of real and fake images organized in a directory structure as mentioned in 'training_model.py'. You can customize the dataset path in the script.
